# autoware.core

An [Autoware](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware) repository that contains a basic set of high-quality, stable ROS packages for autonomous driving.

For a more detailed explanation about Autoware Core, refer to the [Autoware concepts documentation page](https://autowarefoundation.github.io/autoware-documentation/main/design/autoware-concepts/#the-core-module).

For researchers and developers who want to extend the functionality of Autoware Core with experimental, cutting-edge ROS packages, see [Autoware Universe](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware.universe).

We're discussing the interfaces at the [Autoware Architecture WG](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions?discussions_q=label%3Aarchitecture_wg) now, and then we'll start porting the code from Universe to Core.

Note that, the code will be ported from Universe to Core after the interface discussion at [Autoware Architecture WG](https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware/discussions?discussions_q=label%3Aarchitecture_wg) has settled down.
